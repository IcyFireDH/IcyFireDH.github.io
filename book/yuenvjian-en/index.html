<h1 style="text-align:center">英译越女剑 SWORD OF THE YUEH MAIDEN</h1>
<P class="p">　　This is the only short story wrote by Jin Yong. Because of its short length,    
you can't really see Jin Yong's full talent at story-telling. However,    
this translation can give you some idea of what a martial arts story is    
like. My clumsy translation can't really do the original justice, but I    
hope I have stirred your interest enough that you will go out there and    
find out more about Chinese culture, history and legend. The process of    
finding out will not be easy, but I assure you, what you will find will    
never be dull.    
<P class="p">　　<b>Background:</b></H3>    
This story is based on real historical events that occurred during the    
5th century B.C. It 's a period between what's known as the Spring and    
Autumn period and the Warring Kingdoms period. China was yet to be united    
under the First Emperor. The so-called Han race didn't exist yet. China    
was divided into big and small kingdoms, dukedoms and counties which warred    
with each other constantly. </p>
<P class="p">　　It all started when the king of Chuh slept with his son's fiancee. Bad    
move, for any era. The king now feared that his son will turn against him.    
The fear was fanned into action by the allegations of an ambitious minister    
who wanted to destroy the crown prince's faction. The resulting purge destroyed    
many clans and families. One of the family, almost peripheral to the whole    
thing, was the House of Wu. The youngest son, Wu Tzu-Shi, escaped and vowed    
bloody vengeance. </p>
<P class="p">　　After a long and dangerous journey through several kingdoms unwilling    
to help, he arrived at the newly founded kingdom of Wu (No, the Chinese    
characters for the Wu in Wu Tzu-Shi is actually different from the character    
Wu in the Wu kingdom). He helped Prince Ho Lu to assassinate his cousin    
the king in a convoluted power struggle. Then he built up the kingdom of    
Wu from a barely civilized kingdom to a modern kingdom with the best trained    
army in the known world. Sun Tzu, who wrote the immortal Art of War, served    
in Wu at this time. </p>
<P class="p">　　When Wu Tzu-Shi was ready, he managed to convince King Ho Lu to invade    
Chuh. At the time Chuh was a superpower and Wu was an upstart kingdom,    
but the upstart kingdom managed to destroy Chuh's army utterly. Unfortunately,    
Wu Tzu-shi's vengeance was hollow. The object of his vengeance had already    
died several years ago. In his rage, Wu Tzu-Shi exhumed the body of the    
dead king and flogged it until it fell to pieces. </p>
<P class="p">　　The kingdom of Wu proved itself incapable of absorbing the far larger    
kingdom of Chuh, so Wu Tzu-Shi had to take his army back to Wu. Then, Ho    
Lu began a series of wars to establish hegemony over the rest of China.    
It's in one of those wars when he ran into the kingdom of Yueh. The Yueh    
people was then even more primitive then Wu was a few decades ago, but    
they were great fighters. They were ruled by King Kou Chiang. In a pitch    
battle, King Ho Lu was struck by a poison arrow and died. </p>
<P class="p">　　Ho Lu's son Fu Chai became king. He was intent on avenging his father.    
A personal guard was ordered to remind him of this fact periodically by    
saying "Fu Chai, did you forget to avenge the death of your father?" Fu    
Chai then rallied his army and destroyed the army of Yueh. King Kou Chiang    
became a prisoner of Fu Chai for several years. However, Fu Chai was not    
a brutal man. Instead of annexing the kingdom of Yueh and turning Kou Chiang    
into a slave, he released Kou Chiang after extracting an oath of fealty    
from the king of Yueh. Unfortunately, that gesture of mercy was completely    
lost on King Kou Chiang. Kou Chiang, like Wu Tzu-Shi and Fu Chai before    
him, was possessed by the burning desire to avenge the wrongs done him. </p>
<P class="p">　　Kou Chiang hired two wise men from the kingdom of Chuh. One of them    
was Feng Li, the other was Wen Chung. The two began to build up the barbaric    
kingdom of Yueh so one day their king could challenge the power of Wu.    
Many legends are associated with this period of history. One of the legends    
was the legend of the Yueh Maiden.    
<P class="p">　　<b>Story:</b></H3>    
"After you." </p>
<P class="p">　　"After you." </p>
<P class="p">　　The two swordmen turned the point of their blades downward. Their right    
palm holding the sword hilt, their left palm covered their right palm,    
then they bowed deeply to each other in a warrior's salute. </p>
<P class="p">　　Even before the two straightened, a sudden flash of white, then the    
sound of clanging. The two swordmen each retreated one step. The audience    
gave out a soft cry </p>
<P class="p">　　. The swordman in blue cut three times. The liveried swordman blocked    
each cut. The swordman in blue shouted and slashed his sword from the upper    
left corner straight downward. The slash was powerful and fast. The liveried    
swordman was too agile to be caught. A simple jump got him out of the way.    
His body bounced barely after his left feet touched the ground. He returned    
two slashes. The swordman in blue stood still with a grim smile. He moved    
his sword lightly and blocked the attack. </p>
<P class="p">　　The liveried swordman suddenly began running around the swordman in    
blue. He ran faster and faster. The swordman in blue merely stared at the    
point of his enemy's sword. He was ready to strike anytime that point moved    
to attack. The liveried swordman at first ran one way, then the other.    
The swordman in blue started to feel a bit dizzy and said "Are you fighting,    
or running for your life?" The liveried swordman continued running. The    
swordman in blue attempted to cut him down a few times, but his sword always    
fell short. </p>
<P class="p">　　The swordman in blue pulled his sword back to the side of his body and    
bowed his right leg slightly. The liveried swordman thought he saw an opening    
and lounged at his left shoulder, the swordman in blue was merely luring    
his enemy. His sword circled into a direct thrust at the liveried swordman's    
throat. The thrust was too fast to be avoided. The liveried swordman was    
surprised. He threw his sword toward the heart of his enemy. The liveried    
swordman hoped to force the swordman to abort the thrust in order to save    
his own life. </p>
<P class="p">　　Unexpectedly, the swordman in blue didn't attempt to defend himself.    
With a move of his arm, the point of his sword entered the liveried swordman's    
throat. Then the liveried swordman's thrown sword hit his chest with a    
loud clang and fell to the ground. The swordman in blue laughed coldly    
and pulled his sword back. He was wearing a round plate of iron in front    
of his chest, just under the garment. That's why the sword did him no harm.    
The liveried swordman's throat spurted blood and his body convulsed. The    
servants stepped in to remove the body and began to wipe up the blood on    
the ground. </p>
<P class="p">　　The swordman in blue sheathed his sword. He stepped forward and bowed    
toward the north of the hall where the king sat. The king wore a purple    
robe. He is of strange appearance. His neck was excessive long and his    
mouth was sharp as a bird's beak. He smiled and said in a croaking voice    
"The strong one has wonderful sword skill. Award him ten pounds of gold."    
The swordman in blue knelt down on his right knee and bowed "Thank you    
for the award." The king waved his left hand. An official on his right    
shouted "Swordmen of Wu and swordmen of Yueh,second contest!" </p>
<P class="p">　　From the east end of the hall, another liveried swordman walked out    
from his group. This man was tall of stature and held a great sword. The    
sword was nearly four feet in length. The blade was extremely thick and    
was obviously quite heavy. From the west of hall, another swordman in blue    
walked out. He was of medium height. His face was crisscrossed by at least    
twelve or thirteen sword scars. The face seemed no longer human. He must    
have fought hundreds of battles with countless swordmen. The two knelt    
to the king, then they saluted each other. </p>
<P class="p">　　The swordman in blue straightened his body and smiled. His face made    
the smile seemed ugly and cruel. The tall swordman shivered. Then he sighed    
deeply and held his sword with both hands. </p>
<P class="p">　　Suddenly the swordman in blue howled madly like a wolf and thrusted    
his sword. The tall swordman cried, lifted his great sword and cut down    
toward his opponent's head. The swordman in blue dodged while his sword    
made a slash from left to right. The tall swordman lifted the great sword    
and whirled, making the sounds of a great wind. The great weight of the    
sword didn't slow him down in the slightest. </p>
<P class="p">　　The two made thirty passes at each other. The swordman in blue couldn't    
oppose the weight of his opponent's sword. He kept retreating. All the    
other liveried swordman began to show hope on their faces as they anticipated    
their side to win at last. </p>
<P class="p">　　Then the tall swordman made a great cry like the sound of a thunderclap    
and made a horizontal cut with his great sword. The swordman in blue couldn't    
avoid it. He could only block it with his own sword with all his strength.    
Clang! The two swords met. The great sword broke and half of the blade    
flew away. The swordman in blue wielded a far sharper sword. Then the swordman    
in blue made a vertical cut which opened up the tall swordman from throat    
to crotch. The tall swordman howled and kept on howling as he felt to the    
ground. The swordman in blue looked at his fallen opponent for a while    
before returning his sword to the sheath. Then he knelt toward the king.    
His face couldn't disguise his joy of victory. </p>
<P class="p">　　The official said "The strong one's sword skill is impressive. The award    
is ten pounds of gold." The swordman in blue bowed in thanks. There were    
only eight swordmen in blue. Compared with fifty liveried swordmen standing    
at the east side of the hall, they were badly outnumbered. </p>
<P class="p">　　The official said "Swordmen of Wu and swordmen of Yueh, the third contest." </p>
<P class="p">　　Again, one swordman from each walked to the center of the hall. The    
sword of the swordman in blue trembled and shone like bright silk. The    
official said "Good sword!" The swordman in blue thanked his praise. The    
official then said "We have seen one-to-one contests twice. This time,    
two against two!" </p>
<P class="p">　　Two more swordmen entered the arena. The four again saluted the king    
first before saluting each other. Then the swords flashed as the combat    
began. This time, each of the two swordmen on the same side must reinforce    
each other. After a few passes, a liveried swordmen's sword was cut into    
half by his enemy's sword. This liveried swordman was very courageous.    
He carried his broken and jumped toward his enemy. His opponent's sword    
flashed and cut away his right arm together with his right shoulder. Then    
the sword impaled his heart. </p>
<P class="p">　　The other pair was still fighting. The victorious swordman in blue watched    
for a while, then his sword moved. Again, the liveried swordman's sword    
was cut into half, leaving him wide open. His oponent's sword entered his    
chest and exited from his back </p>
<P class="p">　　. The king laughed and clapped "Excellent swords! Excellent sword skills.    
Award them wine and gold. Let us see one contest of four against four!" </p>
<P class="p">　　Four swordmen from each side began combat. The swordmen from the east    
side had already lost three contests. These four fought desperately with    
all their skills. Even if they lost their lives, they meant to win at least    
one contest. Two swordmen in blue concentrated on one liveried swordman.    
The other two swordmen in blue defended them against the other three liveried    
swordmen. These swordmen in blue only defended. Their skill of defense    
was impenetrable. They also made no attempt to attack, all they did was    
preventing the three from aiding their comrade. The other two swordman    
in blue easily killed their lone opponent. Then they repeated their tactic    
again and killed another liveried swordman. </p>
<P class="p">　　The other liveried swordmen saw the death of their comrades. They drew    
their swords and was ready to aid their comrades and chopped the swordmen    
in blue to bits. </p>
<P class="p">　　The official cried out in a clear voice "Those who learned the way of    
the sword, must obey the laws of the swor !" </p>
<P class="p">　　His voice was authoritative. The liveried swordmen quieted down. By    
now everyone could see that the swordmen in blue used completely different    
sword skills. The two who defended were specialized in defense. The two    
who attacked specialized in attack. The attackers always outnumber their    
victim because the defenders watched their back. They could win even if    
their opponents numbered six or even eight. The swords of the two defenders    
formed a sword net which could handle five or even six swordmen easily. </p>
<P class="p">　　The two defenders had cornered a liveried swordman so he was virtually    
neutralized while the two attackers already killed the third liveried swordman.    
The two defenders moved left and right and watched for more enemies while    
the two attackers began on the lone swordman. Even though the liveried    
swordman had no hope of winning, still he didn't throw down his sword to    
admit defeat. Suddenly the four swordmen in blue shouted loudly and their    
four swords impaled the liveried swordman from four directions. </p>
<P class="p">　　The liveried swordman died immediately, but his eyes were opened like    
round saucers. His mouth opened widely. The four swordmen in blue pulled    
out their swords at the same time. The four wiped their swords at the sole    
of their shoes, then they returned their swords back into the sheath. The    
movements were completely synchronized. </p>
<P class="p">　　The king laughed and clapped his hands together again "Excellent sword    
skill! The swordmen of the great kingdom were truly invincible. It's only    
today that we're treated to such a spectacle. Award each swordman ten pounds    
of gold." The four bowed in thanks. They bowed at the same exact angle.    
No one knew how long they practiced to achieve such precision. </p>
<P class="p">　　A swordman in boue turned, picked a long box covered in gold paint and    
said "Our king thank the generous gifts of Your Majesty. His Majesty ordered    
us to return the favor with one precious sword. This sword is newly forged    
in our kingdom for the enjoyment of Your Majesty." </p>
<P class="p">　　The king smiled "Thank you. Minister Feng, bring it over here." </p>
<P class="p">　　The king was Kou Chiang, King of Yueh. The official was Feng Li, the    
royal advisor. The liveried swordmen were the Royal Guards of Yueh. The    
eight swordmen in blue were the messengers sent by Fu Chai, King of Wu.    
Kou Chiang was defeated by Fu Chai and he waited for a chance for vengeance.    
While he was submissive to the Kingdom of Wu on the surface, he secretly    
trained soldiers in preparation for an attack on Wu. In order to test the    
skill of Wu warriors, he sent out the best of his swordmen. He could not    
expect that the Wu swordmen easily killed eight of his finest swordmen.    
He was surprised and angry, but he showed none of it. Instead, he praised    
the sword skills of the Wu swordmen and showed his heartfelt admiration. </p>
<P class="p">　　Feng Li took the golden long box. The box felt very light, as thought    
it's empty. He opened up the cover. Before the other people in the hall    
could see what's in the box, Feng Li's face was illuminated by a faint    
blue light. Everyone cried in surprise. </p>
<P class="p">　　Feng Li took the box to Kou Chiang and bowed "Please look, Your Majesty."    
Kou Chiang saw that the box was lined with red silk. The sword inside it    
had a very thin blade. The light it reflected flowed on its surface like    
water. He said "Excellent sword!" He took the hilt and lifted up the sword.    
The blade trembled slightly, almost as though he could break the blade    
with a flick of his wrist. He thought "The sword blade is too thin. It    
might look good, but it has no practical use." </p>
<P class="p">　　The leader of the swordmen in blue took out a piece of gauze from his    
pocket and threw it into the air. "Please, Your Majesty, point the edge    
of the sword upward so it will meet this falling gauze. You will see that    
this sword is different." The thin gauze fell upon the edge of the sword,    
but the gauze didn't stop falling. It kept falling, as two separate gauzes.    
The people on the hall cheered. </p>
<P class="p">　　The swordman in blue said "This blade might be thin, but it will not    
break even if it blocks a heavy weapon." </p>
<P class="p">　　Kou Chiang said "Minister Feng, try it." </p>
<P class="p">　　Feng said "Yes." He walked in front of a liveried swordman, took out    
the sword and said "Draw, let's try it." The liveried swordman bowed, drew    
his sword, but he didn't dare to strike. Feng Li cried "Strike!" The swordman    
cut downward. Feng met it with his sword. The two swords met. The sword    
blade of the liveried swordmen was cut into two pieces. Before one of the    
pieces flew into him, Feng Li dodged wit great agility. The people inside    
the hall cheered. Were they cheering the sharpness of the blade, or the    
agility of Feng? </p>
<P class="p">　　Feng Li put the sword back into the box and put the box next to the    
feet of the king. Kou Chiang said "Swordmen of the great kingdom, you are    
invited to the next hall for a feast and be awarded for the contest." The    
eight swordmen in blue bowed and left the hall. Kou Chiang waved his hand,    
all the swordmen, servants and ministers left, except for Feng Li. </p>
<P class="p">　　Kou looked at the sword and the blood on the ground and said "What you    
do think?" </p>
<P class="p">　　Feng Li said "Not all the Wu soldiers are as good as these eight. Not    
all swords wielded by them are as sharp as this one. But from this small    
example, we can see the rest. The most terrifying aspect is their technique    
of group fighting, they used the methods of Sun Tzu. I believe that they    
currently have no match in the world." </p>
<P class="p">　　Kou Chiang said "Fu Chai sent these eight just to give me this sword.    
What does he have in mind?" </p>
<P class="p">　　Feng Li said "He wants us to know the difficulty of vengeance." </p>
<P class="p">　　Kou Chiang became angry. He took up the sword and made a backhand stroke.    
The stroke cut up the half of the back of his chair. He shouted "Even if    
the difficulty is one thousand, ten thousand times greater, Kou Chiang    
will not retreat from his goal! One day, I will capture Fu Chai, king of    
Wu and cut off his heead with his sword." Another stroke of the sword cut    
the chair into half. </p>
<P class="p">　　Feng Li bowed and said "Congratualations, Your Majesty." </p>
<P class="p">　　Kou said in surprise "After seeing the ability of the Wu swordmen, what's    
there to congratulate about?" </p>
<P class="p">　　Feng Li said "As long as You Majesty have the determination, anything    
can be accomplished. Concerning this difficulty, I must discuss it with    
Minister Wen." </p>
<P class="p">　　Kou Chiang said "Good, summon Minister Wen." Feng Li left the palace    
and ordered the palace servant to summon Minister Wen Chung. In a while,    
Wen Chung arrived on a speedy horse, then the two walked back into the    
palace </p>
<P class="p">　　. Feng Li was originally a native of Wan, in the Kingdom of Chuh. He    
was not a man concerned with the details of etiquette. Often, he did things    
beyond the expectations of other people. People of his homeland called    
him "Feng the Crazy". When Wen Chung came to be the magistrate of Wan,    
he heard of the Feng Li's reputation. He sent subordinates to summon Feng.    
The subordinates said "That Feng is the famous crazy man of this land.    
Nothing he does makes any sense." Wen Chung smiled "When a man try to do    
something different, other people always say that he is mad. When he has    
a superior opinion, the common of wit will call him stupid. How can you    
understand Master Feng?" So Wen Chung went to visit Feng himself, but Feng    
avoided him. Feng expected that Wen would not give up so easily, so he    
borrowed some proper clothes from his brother. When Wen came back, Feng    
was ready. The two talked and found that they had much in common. </p>
<P class="p">　　They both felt the kingdoms were weak. The kingdom of Chuh was large,    
but chaotic. The only kingdoms which could rise to command the rest were    
located at southeast. Wen Chung resigned his position and went to the kingdom    
of Wu with Feng Li. At the time. the king of Wu's favorite was Wu Tzu-Shi.    
The two lived in the capital for a few month and saw that Wu Tzu-Shi was    
indeed a wise man. They were not necessarily better than him. </p>
<P class="p">　　After some discussion, they decided that although Yueh was a smaller    
kingdom, but they could put their talents to use there. Kou Chiang received    
them warmly and gave them both high positions. </p>
<P class="p">　　Then Kou Chiang ignored the advise of Wen Chung and made war with Wu.    
His army was defeated by the shore of Chiang Tang River. Kou Chiang was    
surrounded at Kuai Chi Mountain and almost died along with his kingdom,    
but he listened to the advise of Feng Li and Wen Chung and bribed the Prime    
Minister of Wu. Fu Chai then listened to the Prime Minister instead of    
the wiser Wu Tzu-Shi and agreed to a peace treaty. Kou Chiang lived in    
Wu as a hostage for a few years, but he was released later. Then Kou Chiang    
slept only on beds made of thorny branches and tasted the bitter juice    
of beef gall bladders to remind himself of the humiliations he suffered.    
He used Wen Chung's Nine Methods to subvert Wu and strengthen Yueh. </p>
<P class="p">　　The Nine Methods were. One, pay respect to the gods and spirits. Two,    
give Fu Chai vast amount of money so he will feel secure as well as becoming    
soft in luxury. Three, borrow food from Wu and return seeds which will    
not grow, causing famine in Wu. Four, give Fu Chai beautiful women such    
as Si Shi and Cheng Dang, so Fu Chai would be paying more attention to    
the beautiful women rather than the affairs of the state. Five, give Fu    
Chai engineers so he started building expensive palaces which drained the    
economy of the country. Six, bribe the ministers of Wu. Seven, distance    
Fu Chai from his wise ministers. The wise Wu Tzu-Shi was eventually forced    
to committ suicide as punishment of a false charge of treason. Eight, hoard    
food so the kingdom of Yueh will have great reserve available. Nine, make    
weapons, train soldier and wait for the chance. Eight methods have succeeded,    
but the ninth had run into great difficulty. </p>
<P class="p">　　Everyone could tell that the eight warriors of Wu were better than anyone    
Yueh could produce. Feng Li told Wen Chung the results of the contest.    
Wen Chung frowned "Brother Feng, the sharpness of their swords is a major    
problem, also the way their swordmen worked together in groups in accordance    
to Sun Tzu's Art of War." Feng Li said "Yes, decades ago, when Sun Tzu    
helped the king of Wu. They destroyed Chuh, the most powerful kingdom in    
the world at the time. In his book, it's said "If I concentrate my forces    
and the enemy's forces is fragmented into ten parts then I can use my unified    
one to attack his ten fragments. Then I will outnumber my enemy and the    
battle will be over." Wu used this principle to achieve local superiority    
against our swordmen." </p>
<P class="p">　　When they talk they arrived in front of Kou Chiang. Kou Chiang was staring    
at the gift sword. After a long while, Kou Chiang lifted up his head and    
said "Minister Wen. Years ago, Wu had the husband-wife team of swordsmiths,    
Keng Chiang and Mo Shei. Yueh had O-Yeh Tzu. Now, all three have died.    
Wu still have great swordsmiths, yet we have no one to succeed O-Yeh Tzu." </p>
<P class="p">　　Wen Chung said "I have heard that O-Yeh Tzu had two students. One is    
named Fong Hu-Tzu, The other is called Hsieh Chu. Fong Hu-Tzu is in the    
kingdom of Chuh. Hsieh is still in Yueh." </p>
<P class="p">　　Kou became glad and said "Summon him. And order someone to go to Chuh    
with gold so we can get Fong Hu-Tzu here as well." </p>
<P class="p">　　The next morning, Wen Chung reported that he already sent someone to    
Chuh. Meanwhile, Hsieh Chu was already here. Kou Chiang grant Hsieh an    
audience and asked "Your master O-Yeh Tzu once followed my father's ordder    
and forged five swords. How do you grade those five swords?" </p>
<P class="p">　　Hsieh said "I have heard my master said that he forged five swords for    
the king. Three large swords and two small swords. They are Trembling Reed,    
Pure Edge, Defeater of Evil, Fish Intestine and the Great Tower. Now, the    
Trembling Reed is in Chuh. Defeater of Evil and Fish Intestine are in Wu.    
Your Majesty still have Pure Edge and Great Tower." </p>
<P class="p">　　Years ago, the Prince Ho Lu of Wu heard of the swords and asked Kou    
Chiang's father for some of the swords. Kou Chiang's father feared the    
might of Wu and gave Holu Trembling Reed, Defeater of Evil and Fish Intestine.    
Using Fish Intestine, Ho Lu assassinated his cousin the king and took the    
throne. Trembling Reed fell into a river and was acquired by the king of    
Chuh. King of Chin heard of this and asked for it. Even after a few wars,    
the king of Chuh still refused to give it up. </p>
<P class="p">　　Hsieh said "My master said, of the five swords, Defeater of Evil is    
of the highest grade. Pure Edge and Trembling Reed are next. Fish Intestine    
is lower and Great Tower ranks last. When Great Tower was forged, the alloy    
was not pure, so it was only a sharp sword and not a truly precious sword." </p>
<P class="p">　　Kou Chiang said "Are you saying my Pure Edge and Great Tower are not    
as good as Fu Chai's Defeater of Evil and Fish Intestine?" </p>
<P class="p">　　Hsieh dare not admit that Kou Chiang's swords was inferior, but Kou    
Chiang knew the answer anyway. </p>
<P class="p">　　Feng Li said "You have the skill of your master. You can forge a few    
swords of your own. They might not be inferior to those owned by Wu." </p>
<P class="p">　　Hsieh said "I cannot forge swords anymore." </p>
<P class="p">　　Feng Li asked "Why?" </p>
<P class="p">　　Hsieh held up his hands. On both his hands, the thumb and the index    
fingers were gone. He said sadly "Thumbs and index fingers are required    
for forging swords. I am a cripple." </p>
<P class="p">　　Kou Chiang said "Did you enemy cut away your fingers?" </p>
<P class="p">　　Hsieh said "No, my fellow student did it." "Your fellow student? You    
mean Fong Hu-Tzu? Why did he doe it? Ah! It must be that you have greater    
skill than he. He beame jealous and cut away your fingers." Hsieh remained    
silent. </p>
<P class="p">　　Ko Chiang said "I was thinking about inviting Fong from Chuh, but now    
I see he won't come because he fears your vengeance." </p>
<P class="p">　　Hsieh said "Your Majesty is indeed wise, but Fong is no longer in Chuh.    
He is in Wu. </p>
<P class="p">　　Ko Chiang said "He...He's in Wu? What's he doing there?" </p>
<P class="p">　　Hsieh said "Three years ago, Fong came to my home and took out a precious    
sword for me to inspect. I was astounded. That sword was forged by my master    
for Chuh. It is named the Flowing Fabric. The blade was full of runes that    
flowed like water. I heard from my master that he forged three swords for    
Chuh. That was one, the others were Dragon Spring and Ching Ah." </p>
<P class="p">　　Kou Chiang said "Then the king of Chuh must have given it to Fong." </p>
<P class="p">　　Hsieh said "Indirectly. Fong said that after the army of Wu broke the    
capital of Chuh. Wu Tzu-shi took the sword from the grave of the previous    
king. When he returned to Wu, he heard of the skills of Fong, so he gave    
the sword to him as a gift. He said the sword was a legacy from our master    
and that Fong was the rightful owner." </p>
<P class="p">　　Kou Chiang said "Wu Tzu-Shi let the sword go? He is truly a great hero    
to let such a treasure go." Then he laughed "Fortunately, Fu Chai has already    
taken care of him for me." Then he asked "What did Wu Tzu-Shi wanted in    
return from Fong?" </p>
<P class="p">　　Hsieh said "Wu Tzu-shi merely said that he admired our master. Fong    
felt grateful after he received the sword, so he went to Wu and thanked    
Wu Tzu-Shi in person. Wu Tzu-Shi treated as an honored guest." </p>
<P class="p">　　Kou Chiang said "That's how he make people become loyal to him, even    
onto death." </p>
<P class="p">　　Hsieh said "Your Majesty is wise, but Fong didn't understand Wu Tzu-shi's    
true intentions, so he asked again and again how he could repay the great    
favor done to him. Wu Tzu -Shi merely said he would not ask anything of    
an honored guest." </p>
<P class="p">　　Kou Chiang said "The old fox!" </p>
<P class="p">　　Hsieh said "Fong finally said to Wu Tzu-shi that he had little skill    
except forging swords. In return for Wu Tzu-Shi's favors, he will forge    
a few precious swords for him." </p>
<P class="p">　　Kou slapped his thigh and said "Got him!" </p>
<P class="p">　　Hsieh said "But Wu Tzu-shi said the kingdome of Wu already had many    
precious swords and needed no more. Besides, the forging of a precious    
sword is a tremendous labor. Years ago, when Keng Chiang and Mo Yeh were    
forging their sword, the sword refused to come into being until Mo Yeh    
flung herself into the fire. Wu Tzu-shi had no intention of repeating that    
kind of tragedy." </p>
<P class="p">　　Kou Chiang said "He didn't want Fong to forge swords for him? Strange." </p>
<P class="p">　　Hsieh said "Fong was baffled too. Then Wu Tzu-shi visited him again.    
They said that the army of Wu was fully capable of fighting with superpowers    
like the kingdoms of Chi and Jin. Wu's warriors were courageous, but their    
skills in chariot warfare were inferior. Moreover, their swords and spears    
were not sharp enough. Fong began to talk to Wu Tzu-Shi about the way of    
forging swords. What Wu Tzu-Shi wanted wasn't a few precious swords with    
mysterius powers, what he wanted was thousands and thousands of sharp swords." </p>
<P class="p">　　Kou Chiang understood and looked at Feng Li and Wen Chung. Worry filled    
Wen Chung's face. He asked "Minister Feng, what do you think?" </p>
<P class="p">　　Feng Li said "Even though Wu Tzu-shi is crafty, he is not wise enough    
to escape Your Majesty's schemes." </p>
<P class="p">　　Kou Chiang laughed "I am afraid that I have never been Wu Tzu-shi's    
match." </p>
<P class="p">　　Feng Li said "Wu Tzu-shi is already dead. What more can he do to threaten    
Yueh?" </p>
<P class="p">　　Kou Chiang laughed "True. Hsieh Chu. Did Fong finally started forging    
swords?" </p>
<P class="p">　　Hsieh said "Yes. He went to Mt. Mo Keng. He saw one thousand swordsmiths    
working there. He corrected and improved their techniques. After this,    
every sword in Wu is sharper than anything made in other kingdoms." </p>
<P class="p">　　Kou Chiang nodded "So that's why." </p>
<P class="p">　　Hsieh said "After one year, Fong became too fatigued to continue, so    
he told Wu Tzu-shi my name. Wu Tzu-shi readied lavish gifts and asked Fong    
to invite me to work for him as well. I remembered the hatred between Wu    
and Yueh. If Wu's sharp swords could kill the people of Chi and Jin, they    
could also kill the people of my home, so I counseled Fong not to return    
to Wu." </p>
<P class="p">　　Kou nodded in approval "You have foresight." </p>
<P class="p">　　Hsieh said "Thank for your praise, Your Majesty, but he didn't listen    
to me. That night he slept in my home. In the middle of the night, suddenly    
he put his sword at my neck, then he chopped off four of my fingers so    
I'll never forge another sword." </p>
<P class="p">　　Kou Chiang became angry "If he fell into my hands, I would chop him    
into meat paste!" </p>
<P class="p">　　Wen Chung said "Master Hsieh, even though you cannot forge swords by    
yourself, but you can teach our swordsmiths. We, too, can make as many    
sharp swords as the Wu swordsmiths." </p>
<P class="p">　　Hsieh said "Minister Wen, both Yueh and Wu produce the necessary iron    
needed for sword blades, but Yueh produces copper and Wu produces zinc." </p>
<P class="p">　　Feng Li said "Wu Tzu-Shi is guarding the zinc mines and forbids any    
private mining, is that right?" </p>
<P class="p">　　Hsieh showed surprise on his face "So you knew already." </p>
<P class="p">　　Feng Li smiled "No, I am merely speculating. Now that he's dead, his    
order may not be followed anymore. We now can purchase zinc, if we're willing    
to pay for it.." </p>
<P class="p">　　Kou Chiang said "But a source of water far away cannot extinguish a    
nearby conflagration. By the time we gather all the materials, train the    
swordsmiths and start production, at least two or three years would have    
passed. That's not counting any setbacks along the way. If Fu Chai died    
before we're ready, wouldn't that be the greatest regret in our lives?" </p>
<P class="p">　　Feng Li and Wen Chung bowed deeply "Yes, we will find another way." </p>
<P class="p">　　Feng Li walked out of the palace, thinking "His Majesty couldn't wait    
two or three more years? Why, I can't even wait one more day...." A dull    
pain came to his chest as he remembered the image of that unmatched beauty    
which could stun the world. </p>
<P class="p">　　Her name was Si Shi. She lived next to Huan Sha River He found that    
woman who gathered all the beauty of the land of Yueh into her person and    
he had to send her away into the palace of Wu. </p>
<P class="p">　　The road from the capital of Yueh to the capital of Wu was not long,    
only a few days by river, but that was long enough for love to grow beyond    
control. The white face of Si Shi was full of pearl-like tears and her    
voice was soft as a whispering stream "Shao Bo, promise me that you will    
come and get me as soon as possible. I will wait for you, day and night.    
Say that you will never forget me, forever and ever." </p>
<P class="p">　　Vengeance against Wu could wait, as far as Feng Li was concerned, but    
Yi Kwan,that's his name for Si Shi, was in the embrace of King Fu Chai.    
Love and jealousy gnawed at his heart. He must find to way to make as many    
sharp swords as possible, even sharper than those wielded by the invincible    
Wu swordmen.... </p>
<P class="p">　　He walked aimlessly on the street. Eighteen armed guards followed him    
faithfully. </p>
<P class="p">　　Suddenly someone was singing a Wu song "My sword is sharp! My enemy    
has no courage! My sword is sharp! My enemy has no head!" </p>
<P class="p">　　Eight men in blue, arm in arm, swaggered down the street, showing no    
concern for the pedestrians who were hurrying out of their way. They were    
the eight Wu swordmen. They were obviously very drunk. </p>
<P class="p">　　Feng Li frowned. He could feel his anger rising. </p>
<P class="p">　　The eight swordmen stopped in front of Feng Li. One of them looked sideways    
with his drunken eyes and said "You...you are Minister Feng?" Then he broke    
into uncontrollable giggles. Two guards leaped in front of Feng Li and    
said "Don't be so rude. Make way!" </p>
<P class="p">　　The eight swordmen merely laughed and mimicked their words "Don't be    
so rude. Make way!" </p>
<P class="p">　　Two guards pulled out their swords and cried "By royal decree, those    
who dare to interfere with Minister Feng's welfare is to be executed!" </p>
<P class="p">　　One of the Wu swordman's body swayed as he said "Execute you, or me?" </p>
<P class="p">　　Feng's mind was working. "They were the subjects of Wu. Even though    
they are rude. We cannot affford to fight them." Before he could tell his    
guards to pull back, a bright sword flashed. The guards screamed. Then    
their swords dropped to the ground. One of the Wu swordman returned his    
sword into the sheath, his face was full of gloating pride. The rest of    
Feng Li's guards pulled out their swords and surrounded the eight Wu swordmen. </p>
<P class="p">　　The leader raised his head and laughed "We never planned to return to    
Wu alive anyway. Let's see how big an army you need in order to kill us!"    
With a shout, eight swords leaped out of their sheaths. Eight swordmen    
stood back to back, forming a circle. </p>
<P class="p">　　Feng Li thought "If one could not endure small slights, then one would    
never achieve great things." He shouted "These eight are ambassadors from    
the Great Kingdom. Don't treat them with ill manners. Back!" Then he retreated    
to the side of the street. His guards were angry enough to spit fire from    
their eyes, but they dare not disobey him. Reluctantly they retreated to    
the side of the street as well. </p>
<P class="p">　　The they heard the cries of a herd of goats. A young maiden dressed    
in pale green robe herded tens of goats down the street. The goats started    
to go around the eight Wu swordmen. One swordman was feeling cheated of    
a good fight, so his sword moved and a goat was neatly bisected. The cut    
was so neat that even the nose of the goat was severed into two precisely    
equal parts. His seven friends cheered. Even Feng Li could not fault his    
sword skill. </p>
<P class="p">　　The young maiden's bamboo stick moved and herded the rest of goats behind    
her. Then she said "Why did you kill my goat?" The voice was feminine and    
clear, but it also contained anger. </p>
<P class="p">　　The goat killer cut his sword into air a few times and laughed "Little    
girl, I will cut you into half just like this goat!" </p>
<P class="p">　　Feng Li cried "Lady, please come over here. They are drunk." </p>
<P class="p">　　The maiden said "Even if you are drunk, that's no excuse to behave rudely." </p>
<P class="p">　　The swordman's sword circled above her head. "I was thinking of cutting    
off your head, but now I see you're quite pretty, so I changed my mind."    
His seven friends laughed again. </p>
<P class="p">　　Feng Li looked at her. She had an oval face, long eyelashes and clear,    
white skin. Her face was pretty and her body was slende, even seemingly    
frail. He cried again "Lady, over here." The maiden said "Of course." </p>
<P class="p">　　The Wu swordman's sword reached out toward toward her belt. "Why..."    
Before he could finished, the maiden's bamboo stick flickered and stabbed    
into his wrist. The swordman only felt a sudden pain on his wirst and dropped    
his sword. The bamboo stick raised upward, followed by another stab into    
the swordman's right eye. The swordman screamed as he covered his blinded    
eye. </p>
<P class="p">　　The maiden's movement might be simple, but for some reason, the Wu swordman    
could not block or even avoid her bamboo stick. The other seven swordmen    
was much surprised. One of them pulled back his sword and thrusted it toward    
the maiden's right eye. As the sword sped forward, everyone could hear    
a loud whoosh, signaling the strength behind the thrust. </p>
<P class="p">　　The maiden didn't even move her feet. Her bamboo stick moved again.    
This time she stabbed at the swordman's shoulder. The stab was so fast    
that although it started after the thrust, it arrived well before the thrust    
could reach her. The swordman cried out in pain as all the strength went    
out of his thrust. Then the maiden's wrist flicked and the bamboo stick    
went into his right eye. The swordman screamed like a butchered pig as    
his two fists waved aimlessly. </p>
<P class="p">　　Now, the maiden made four moves and two Wu swordmen were disabled. The    
spectator only saw her making some movements with her bamboo stick. Even    
though she moved too fast to be seen clearly, but the technique she used    
was clearly derived from some sort of high sword skill. Feng was both surprised    
and gladdened, but now he saw that the maiden had to face six Wu swordmen.    
He hurriedly said "Swordmen of Wu. It would be bad for the honor of Wu    
if the six of you gang up on a defenseless girl. Even you win with you    
superior numbers......" He clapped his hands together. His guards leaped    
into the street and surrounded the Wu swordmen. </p>
<P class="p">　　The maiden smiled "Even the odds of six against one is not enough for    
you." Her left hand lifted slightly. The bamboo stick on her right hand    
thrusted toward yet another swordman's eye. She moved her stick and stabbed    
toward another swordman's chest. Three swords sped toward her. She moved    
agilely and avoided all three sword, then she counterattacked. One swordman    
was stabbed on the wrist and lost hold on his sword. </p>
<P class="p">　　Feng Li's guard was ready to leap into battle, but they could not penetrate    
into the sword net formed by the Wu swordmen. </p>
<P class="p">　　The maiden moved between the six swordmen. Her long sleeves and long    
belt waved in the wind beautifully. Then the cries of pain came from one    
after another Wu swordmen as their swords dropped to the ground. The fight    
was over. Each of the Wu swordmen lost an eye. Some lost the right eye.    
Some lost the left eye. </p>
<P class="p">　　The maiden pulled back her bamboo stick and said "You killed my goat.    
Now compensate me." </p>
<P class="p">　　The Wu swordmen were angry and scared. Some were roaring in fury. Some    
were shivering in fear. These eight were battle-hardened veterans. Ordinarily    
they would not lose control of their demeanor even if someone cut of both    
of their hands, but what happened to them was so beyond their comprehension    
that they had not idea how they should act. </p>
<P class="p">　　The maiden said "If you don't compensate me for my goat, I will take    
your other eye." The Wu swordmen jumped back involuntarily. </p>
<P class="p">　　Feng Li said "Lady, I will give you one hundred goats, but let these    
eight men leave." </p>
<P class="p">　　The maiden smiled "You're a nice man. I don't want one hundred goats.    
I only want one." </p>
<P class="p">　　Feng Li said to the guard "Accompany the ambassadors from the Great    
Kingdom back to the palace. Summon the physicians to treat their wounds."    
The eight Wu swordmen left crestfallen, like cocks who had lost a fight. </p>
<P class="p">　　Feng Li walked toward the maiden and said "Lady, what is your respected    
surname?" The maiden said "What did you say?" He rephrased the question    
"What is your name?" The maiden said "Oh, my name is Ah Ching. What is    
yours?" </p>
<P class="p">　　Feng Li smiled and thought "So she is just a simple country girl unversed    
in courtly manners. Yet she learned this godlike sword skill. I only have    
to learn who her master is, then I can invite her teacher to train Yueh    
warriors. Wu will not be able to stand against us." His heart warmed as    
he realized that he's closer to bring Si Shi back. Then he said "I am called    
Feng Li. Lady, why don't you have a meal in my home?" Ah Ching said "No,    
I have to herd the goats to pasture." Feng Li said "I have a large lawn    
in my home. Your goats can feed there, then I will compensate you with    
ten fat goats." </p>
<P class="p">　　Ah Ching clapped her hands together and laughed "You have a big lawn?    
Good, but I don't want any goat from you. You didn't kill this goat." She    
knelt to the ground and petted the dead goat. Then she said sadly "Old    
White, bad man killed you. I can't save you this time." </p>
<P class="p">　　Feng Li ordered his guard "Sew the body back together and bury it next    
to this lady's house." </p>
<P class="p">　　Ah Ching stood up. Her face was stained by tears, but her eyes was happy.    
"Feng Li, you won't let them eat Old White?" </p>
<P class="p">　　Feng Li said "Of course not. That's your Old White. No one is permitted    
to eat him." </p>
<P class="p">　　Ah Ching sighed "You are nice. I always hate to let other people kill    
my goats so they can eat the meat, but mother said that unless we sell    
our goat, we will not have money for rice." </p>
<P class="p">　　Feng Li said "From today on, I will ask people to send your mother rice    
and good clothes. You don't have to sell your goats anymore." </p>
<P class="p">　　Ah Ching became happy and embraced Feng Li "You are a good man." </p>
<P class="p">　　Feng Li held her hand, afraid that she might disappear like some immortal    
from legend. The goats followed them back to his mansion. </p>
<P class="p">　　As Ah Ching herded her goats into the mansion she said "Your house is    
so large! How can you live here alone?" </p>
<P class="p">　　Feng Li smiled "Yes, I think this house is too big for me. Why don't    
you come live here with your mother? Who else do you have in your family?" </p>
<P class="p">　　Ah Ching said "Just me and my mom. I don't know if my mom wants to come.    
She always says that I shouldn't talk to strange man, but you are a good    
man. You won't harm us." </p>
<P class="p">　　Feng Li told Ah Ching to leave the goats in the garden and ordered his    
servants to pick out the best snacks for Ah Ching. The servants watched    
in shock as the goats devoured the expensive flowers in the garden. They    
were even more shocked when they observed their master watching the destruction    
with a happy smile. </p>
<P class="p">　　Ah Ching ate the pastries and drank the tea. Feng Li talked with and    
discovered that she's innocent of the intrigues of the world. Finally he    
asked "Ah Ching, who taught you sword skills?" </p>
<P class="p">　　Ah Ching's large, clear eyes opened wider and said "Sword skill? No    
one ever taught me anything." </p>
<P class="p">　　Feng Li said "The way you used that bamboo stick. That's sword skill.    
Who taught that?" </p>
<P class="p">　　Ah Ching shook her head "No one. I always knew how to play with the    
bamboo stick." </p>
<P class="p">　　Feng Li saw that she was too innocent to lie and thought "Did heaven    
finally send down a miracle?" He asked again "Do you know how to play with    
this bamboo since you're a child?" </p>
<P class="p">　　Ah Ching said "No. When I was thirteen, Grandpa White came to ride my    
goats. I wouldn't let him and beat him off with my bamboo stick. He returned    
with a bamboo stick. I then fought with him. At first, he always score    
hits on me and I can't score hits on him. I play this everyday. Now, I    
score hits on him most of the time and he can't score hits on me. He isn't    
coming back as often now." </p>
<P class="p">　　Feng thought he finally hit something and said "Where does this Grandpa    
White live? Can you take me to him?" </p>
<P class="p">　　Ah Ching said "He lives in the mountains. You can't find him. He usually    
comes and find me. I never tried to find him." </p>
<P class="p">　　Feng Li said "I want to meet him. Is there a way?" </p>
<P class="p">　　Ah Ching said "Hmm. You can follow me to pasture. We will wait for him    
on the mountain side. I don't know when he'll show though." She sighed    
"I haven't seen him for a while now." </p>
<P class="p">　　Feng Li said to himself "This is for Yi Kwan and the kingdom of Yueh.    
A little goat herding won't hurt." so he said "Good, I'll accompany you    
and wait for Grandpa White." He thought "Grandpa White must be the sword    
sage who taught this girl. He must have loved her youth and innocence,    
so he used play to teach her. He could make a young girl into the such    
a great master, then he could make our warriors destroy Wu. </p>
<P class="p">　　After the meal, Feng Li followed her to mountain pastures to her goats.    
His subordinates didn't understand the reason. They were all baffled. Day    
after day, Feng Li went with Ah Ching to herd goat and sang songs, waiting    
for Grandpa White. </p>
<P class="p">　　On the fifth day, Wen Chung came to Feng Li's mansion and saw a very    
worried chamberlain. He asked "I haven't seen Minister Feng for a few days    
now. The King is worried and ordered to me to visit. Did Minister Feng    
come down sick?" </p>
<P class="p">　　The chamberlain said "Minister Feng is healthy, but...but.." </p>
<P class="p">　　"But?" </p>
<P class="p">　　"Minister Wen is the best friend of Miister Feng. You can say things    
to him that are not appropriate for us to say. Why don't you try to talk    
some sense into him?" </p>
<P class="p">　　Wen Chung was baffled "Sense? What's wrong with Minister Feng?" </p>
<P class="p">　　"Minister Feng fell love with that little shepherdess. Every morning    
he leaves with her and don't return until after sundown. He won't permit    
any guards following him. He will not be bothered even when I have urgent    
affairs." </p>
<P class="p">　　Wen Chung laughed and thought "When Brother Feng was living in the kingdom    
of Chuh, everyone called him Feng the Crazy. He never does things like    
other people." </p>
<P class="p">　　At that time, Feng Li was sitting on a mountain side grassland and telling    
Ah Ching the story of the goddess Hsiang Fei. Ah Ching was sitting close    
by his side and listened to him intent, her large bright eyese never left    
his face. Suddenly she said "Hsiang Fei is really that beautiful?" </p>
<P class="p">　　Feng Li said "Her eyes are clearer and brighter than the water in this    
mountain stream..." </p>
<P class="p">　　Ah Ching said "Does she have fish in her eyes?" </p>
<P class="p">　　Feng Li continued "Her skin is like the clouds, but fairer." </p>
<P class="p">　　Ah Ching said "Are there birds flying in those clouds?" </p>
<P class="p">　　Feng Li continued obliviously "Her lips are softer than the petal of    
this flower and redder. Her lips are moist, even more than the dews on    
this petal. When Hsiang Fei stands next to the river, the beauty of her    
reflection made all the riverside flowers wilt in shame. Even fish dare    
not swim in water for fear of rumpling her reflection. When her white hand    
is dipped into the river, it was so soft that it could almost melt into    
the water..." </p>
<P class="p">　　Ah Ching said "You saw her, didn't you. How else can you describe her    
so clearly?" </p>
<P class="p">　　Feng Li said "I saw her. I saw her very, very clearly." </p>
<P class="p">　　Of course, he was referring to Si Shi, not the goddess Hsiang Fei. </p>
<P class="p">　　He looked at the north. His eyes looked beyond a wide, roaring river.    
Is the beauty in the royal palace of Wu. Is she with King Fu Chai? Is she    
thinking about me? </p>
<P class="p">　　Ah Ching said "Feng Li! Your beard is strange, can I touch it?" </p>
<P class="p">　　Feng Li thought "Is she weeping, or laughing?" </p>
<P class="p">　　Ah Ching said "Feng Li, you have two strands of white beard, just like    
my goats." </p>
<P class="p">　　Feng Li thought "When we're separated, she wept on my shoulder. Her    
tear soaked half of my robe. I never washed that robe. My tears were mingled    
with hers on that robe." </p>
<P class="p">　　Ah Ching said "Feng Li. Can I pull out one of your beard? I will pull    
gently. You won't feel a thing." </p>
<P class="p">　　Feng Li thought "She said she loved riding in a boat and float with    
the currents. After I take her back, I will not be a court minister anymore.    
I will ride a boat with her, floating in rivers and lakes, for the rest    
of my life." </p>
<P class="p">　　Suddenly, he felt a sharp pain on his chin. Ah Ching pulled out a strand    
of his beard. She laughed prettily. Suddenly the laugh was cut off and    
she said "You're here again!" </p>
<P class="p">　　A green shadow flashed as Ah Ching shot forward. A green blur and a    
white blur was moving quickly around each other. </p>
<P class="p">　　Feng Li cried gladly "Grandpa White's here!" It's a while before the    
two combatants slowed down enough for him to get a good look. Then he got    
a great surprise. </p>
<P class="p">　　The one fighting Ah Ching wasn't human. It was a white ape. </p>
<P class="p">　　The white ape, too, was holding a bamboo stick. The white ape performed    
intricate sword forms. The whooshing sound of the stick signaled the great    
strength it put into each form. But everytime he attack, Ah Ching was always    
able to block or redirect each blow and counterattack using even more intricate    
sword forms. </p>
<P class="p">　　When Ah Ching fought the Wu swordmen, the forms she used were minimal.    
Only now Feng Li witnessed the vast skill Ah Ching wielded. He was no expert    
in swords, but he had looked at the Yueh swordmen train for many years.    
Now, he realized that the best swordmen of Yueh were but children playing    
with toys when compared to Ah Ching and Grandpa. </p>
<P class="p">　　The white ape's attacks sped up faster and faster. Ah Ching slowed down    
instead. She stood still, but each time she thrusted with her bamboo stick,    
the white ape was forced to jump back. </p>
<P class="p">　　Ah Ching forced the white ape three steps, then she pulled back her    
stick and stood still. The white ape held his stick in two hands and jumped    
to attack. Feng Li saw the strength of the attack and cried out "Watch    
out!" Ah Ching's stick moved too fast to be seen. There were two muffled    
sounds of impact, then the white ape's bamboo stick dropped to the ground.    
The white ape howed and jumped up to a tree. Then it leaped away. The howl    
was intense, but became muter as the it went farther away. The howl reverberated    
long after the white ape was gone. </p>
<P class="p">　　Ah Ching turned back and sighed "Grandpa broke both of his arms. Now    
he won't come play with me anymore." </p>
<P class="p">　　Feng Li said "You broke his arms?" </p>
<P class="p">　　Ah Ching nodded " Grandpa is very angry today. Three times, he tried    
to leap over and kill you." </p>
<P class="p">　　Feng Li said in surprise "Kill me? Why?" </p>
<P class="p">　　Ah Ching shook her head "I don't know." </p>
<P class="p">　　Feng Li became scared in secret "If Ah Ching didn't stop it, that white    
ape can kill me, easy as blowing away a pile of ash!" </p>
<P class="p">　　The next morning, Ah Ching faced twenty of the best swordmen of Yueh    
alone. Feng Li knew that Ah Ching could not teach other people how to use    
the sword the way she did, so the only way was for the Yueh swordmen to    
imitate her. </p>
<P class="p">　　The problem was no Yueh swordmen could last three passes from her.Whenever    
Ah Ching's bamboo stick moved, her opponent either lost his sword, or got    
stabbed in some delicate area. </p>
<P class="p">　　The next day, she defeated thirty swordmen. The third day, thirty more    
lost. </p>
<P class="p">　　The fourth day, Feng Li went to ask her for another lesson, but he could    
not find her. He went to her home, but the house was empty. Feng Li sent    
hundreds of his servants and guards into the mountains to look for her,    
but no one could find any trace of her. </p>
<P class="p">　　The eighty Yueh swordmen didn't learn the true sword skill from Ah Ching,    
but they saw the smallest portion of the ultimate sword skill. All the    
swordmen now knew the true height sword skill could go. The eighty swordmen    
tried to teach the small portion they could understand to their comrades.    
Even this pale shadow of a pale shadow of the ultimate skill was enough,    
Yueh swordmen became invincible. </p>
<P class="p">　　King Kou Chiang ordered Hsieh Chu to forge thousands of sharp swords. </p>
<P class="p">　　Three years later, Kou Chiang attacked Wu. The armies of Yueh and Wu    
met next to a lake. Five thousand Yueh swordmen marched forward. Wu swordmen    
met them. Yueh swords flashed and the Wu army was shattered. </p>
<P class="p">　　King Fu Chai retreated to Yu Hong Mountain. The army of Yueh followed.    
The second battle ensued. The Wu army was again defeated. Fu Chai committed    
suicide in order to avoid the cruel fate Kou Chiang had in store for him.    
Yueh took the capital of Wu. </p>
<P class="p">　　Feng Li led one thousand swordmen and rushed to King Fu Chai's resort    
palace. That was where Si Shi lived. He ran into the palace, shouting "Yi    
Kwan! Yi Kwan!" </p>
<P class="p">　　He ran past a long corridor, his footstep echoed clearly. The corridor    
was hollow underneath. Si Shi walked lightly, the rhythm of her steps was    
more enchanting than any music. Fu Chai built this palace, this corridor    
in order to listen to the melody of her footsteps. </p>
<P class="p">　　At the other end of the corridor, music came, like the sound of a happy    
mandolin, like the clear sound of a zither. A soft voice said "Shao Bo,    
is that really you?" </p>
<P class="p">　　Feng Li felt blood rushing upward from his chest and shouted "It's I.    
It's I. I have come for you." His own voice seemed like the voice of a    
stranger, speaking from far away. He ran forward with uneven steps. </p>
<P class="p">　　The music came down the corridor, a soft body entered his embrace. </p>
<P class="p">　　The spring night was meltingly warm. Flower fragrance floated through    
the curtains, entering the chambers of the resort palace. Feng Li and Si    
Shi talked about their longing for each other. </p>
<P class="p">　　Suddenly the sound goat penetrated into their awareness. </p>
<P class="p">　　Feng LI said "You can't forget you homeland? You have goats here?" </p>
<P class="p">　　Si Shi shook her head. She wondered about the goats, but she couldn't    
think of anything else in the presence of the man she loved. She held Feng    
Li's hand, and fiery blood flowed faster through their arteries. </p>
<P class="p">　　Suddenly, the voice of a woman sounded "Feng Li! Bring out you Si Shi.    
I'll kill her!" </p>
<P class="p">　　Feng Li stood up. Si Shi felt his palm suddenly turning cold. Feng Li    
recognized Ah Ching's voice. Her voice came from outside of the resort    
palace. </p>
<P class="p">　　Feng Li was fearful and puzzled. "Why does she want to kill Yi Kwan?    
Yi Kwan had never wronged her." Then he understood "She's not really a    
simple village girl. She always liked me." The understanding only made    
him more fearful. </p>
<P class="p">　　He had gone through many, many difficult decisions as well as dangerous    
situations. The fear he felt when he was trapped with Kou Chiang in a Wu    
siege was far less than what he felt now. Si Shi felt his palm trembbling    
and covered with cold sweat. </p>
<P class="p">　　Feng Li was not afraid of his own death. He feared for Si Shi. </p>
<P class="p">　　Feng Li pulled himself under control and said "I will go see this person."    
He released Si Shi's hand and walked out of the palace. </p>
<P class="p">　　Eighteen swordmen followed him. They all heard Ah Ching's cry. They    
were baffled and curious. Feng Li oly saw the clear moonlight outside,    
but no one was visible. He cried out loudly "Lady Ah Ching, please come    
here. We have things to talk about." But he heard no reply. He waited,    
but Ah Ching did not come. He ordered one thousand armored soldiers and    
one thousand elite swordmen to be moved to the resort palace. </p>
<P class="p">　　He returned to Si Shi and held her hands again. He didn't say anything.    
He was planning as he never planned before "Should I let one of the servant    
maids pretending to be Si Shi and let Ah Ching kill her? Should I commit    
suicide before Ah Ching so she will spare Si Shi? Should I order two thousand    
archers surrounding this place and shoot Ah Ching full of arrows if she    
tries to force her way in?" Every plan he had was flawed. He also didn't    
want to kill Ah Ching, who had made the destruction of Wu possible. He    
stared at Shi Si. Suddenly he felt warmth in his heart "It's good that    
we'll die this way. At least we spend sometime together before we die together." </p>
<P class="p">　　Hours passed. Si Shi felt that Feng's hand became warmer. He lost his    
fear and began to smile. </p>
<P class="p">　　The rising sun cast its rays through the window. </p>
<P class="p">　　Suddenly the the sound of a fight came from outside the palace door.    
Then the incessant sound of weapons dropping to the ground. The sound drew    
closer and closer, like a giant serpent worming its way into the palace.    
Then the sound of dropping weapons came from the walkways just outside    
the room they were in. Two thousand warriors were not enough to stop Ah    
Ching. </p>
<P class="p">　　Ah Ching's voice said "Feng Li, where are you?" </p>
<P class="p">　　Feng Li said calmly "Ah Ching, I'm here." </p>
<P class="p">　　Before he even finished the word "here", the curtain parted and a green    
shadow came flying in. Ah Ching, dressed in her usual green stood before    
them. She pointed her bamboo stick at Si Shi. She stared at the face of    
Shi Si, the killing rage on face gradually disappeared, replaced with disappointment    
and self-pity, then it changed to surprise, admiration and finally worship.    
She whispered "There...there really is such beauty under heaven! Feng Li,    
she is even more....more beautiful than you described." Her slender waist    
turned. With a cry, she flew up through the window. The cry went farther    
and farther until its reverberation was left. </p>
<P class="p">　　The surviving guards ran inside the room. One of them bowed "Minister,    
are you all right?" Feng Li merely dismissed them with a wave of his hand.    
Then he held Si Shi's hand and said "Let's change into the clothes of commners.    
We'll go rowing a boat upon Lake Tai and never return to this place." </p>
<P class="p">　　Happiness shone from Si Shi's eyes. Suddenly she frowned and she reached    
toward her heart. Ah Ching's bamboo stick didn't touch her, but the pure    
chi from the stick had reached into her body and did her some slight harm. </p>
<P class="p">　　In the next two thousand years, all people know that the most beautiful    
image in the world was Si Shi holding her hands in front of her bosom.    
<P class="p">　　<b>Where are they now?</b></H3>    
King Kou Chiang finally got his vengeance, but something had happened to    
him during all those years when the only emotion he could feel was hate.    
Feng Li must have sensed it. He resigned his post and told his buddy Wen    
Chung to resign with him. He said "Kou Chiang is someone who you can depend    
on during hard times, but it will be impossible to share good times with    
him." Wen Chung didn't believe his old friend. He believed that he could    
finally enjoy the rewards he deserved. </p>
<P class="p">　　Feng Li disappeared from history. Some said that he became a hermit.    
Some said that he became a merchant prince who owned the wealth of kingdoms.    
Si Shi became the Chinese version of Helen, the beauty who destroyed a    
great kingdom. Some said that Si Shi went with Feng Li and they lived happily    
ever after. Some said that Si Shi died when Kou Chiang's wife, fearing    
losing her husband, tied a rock to the woman's back and sank her in a lake,    
gloating "Now, you never have to grow old." You can pick the ending you    
prefer. </p>
<P class="p">　　Kou Chiang became as Feng Li predicted, cruel and merciless. Wen Chung    
was forced to commit suicide when he was wrongfully charged with treason.    
The end he inflicted upon Wu Tzu-shi became his own end. Kou Chiang became    
full of pride. He made war with the great powers of northern China. The    
wars brought no decisive victory. Then he died. After his death his kingdom    
fell apart. Eventually, Chuh absorbed the territories of Wu and Yueh. The    
Yueh people fled south. Over the centuries, they were pushed farther south    
by the expanding Chinese empire until they entered present day Vietnam.    
They are there still. </p>
<P class="p">　　Recently, an archaeological excavation in Hunan uncovered two bronze    
swords. One of them was thought to be the sword of Fu Chai. The other was    
attributed to be the sword owned by Kou Chiang. The legends of the precious    
swords have some basis in fact. If anyone know more about the archaeological    
findings, please e-mail me. The swords Fish Intestine and Defeater of Evil    
were buried with King Ho Lu, Fu Chai's father. The locals swore that they    
periodically saw a white tiger standing upon the tomb of Ho Lu. The white    
tiger was the symbol of metal, so the locals believe that the tiger was    
the personification of the magic swords under there. Believe it or not. </p>
<P class="p">　　As for the Yueh Maiden, she never existed in real history. She always    
existed in the land of legends and there, presumably, she roams still.    
Doubtlessly she has performed many great deeds there, deeds which will    
remain unknown until some scribe comes and tell the tales as they deserve    
to be told.  </p>
